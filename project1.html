            <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">When I read the description of the home work "Come up with a natural system you'd like to represent in code”, I thought about what is the most natural phenomenon in this world. In my opinion, it is the cycle of life, it is the birth, growth, maturity to old age. No natural creature escapes such a law, nor man, nor trees. I have read about recursive coding before, and I would like to take this opportunity to try to apply this code, so I finally decided to represent the process of trees growing in all seasons in code.</p>
            <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">At first, I wanted to focus on autumn because I can code the recursive tree and has some interactive leaves. At this stage, I didn't have a lot of ideas about interaction, but simply wanted to control the direction with the mouse. So I just made the following diagram. </p>
            <img class="full mb-5" src="Project1/version1.jpg">
            <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">But after the first week of critique, I gained a lot of interesting interaction ideas. I plan to change the season by clicking the mouse and control the speed and direction of the wind with the position of the mouse. So I got a second version of the diagram. </p>
            <img class="full mb-5" src="Project1/version2.jpg">
            <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">The process of making the diagram was also the process that helped me organize the structure of the code. In the diagram I have listed the elements that should appear in the picture, they include the background, the tree and the leaves. Among them, the writing of the trees and the interaction of the leaves were two difficult points. Therefore, I plan to start with these two aspects. Also, to save time, at the beginning I made it in black and white colors and graphics. By studying the teacher's demos and online examples, I extracted the logic I could use and modified it to finally achieve the initial interaction. </p>
            <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">The next week, with the help of the professor, I was able to fully implement the interaction. So I started to modify the visuals, adding colors to the background, trees and leaves. Finally finished the project. </p>
