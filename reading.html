          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">"What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact." </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">The core of a prototype is to help the viewer better understand the product or explore its possibilities. It is the bridge between the designer's imagination and the future work. Therefore, neither what the prototype is made from nor how the prototype is made should be considered important, but it is the ideas and insights behind the prototype that are important as long as designers can convey theirs message to the audience. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“In the authors’ experience, no one tool supports iterative design work in all of the important areas of investigation.“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">Since each prototype is designed to fit its specific usage scenario, the purpose of the prototype varies. Also, different prototyping approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Something like paper prototyping takes less time and so allows the designer to test multiple potential solutions, while C is more accurate and powerful and can show enough details. Therefore, when designers are prototyping, it is really essential to embrace the different things. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“We define the dimensions of the model as role; look and feel; and implementation.“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">This tells us the key factors in making and testing the prototype. Using the terms in IxD to interpret them, “role” is “user”; “look and feel” is the “user experience” and “interactions”; “implementation” is “technology” and “features”. Combining what the book said and what I learned in IxD, prototypes were made to test if the functionality catered to what we were supposed to make the user feel and do. None of these elements were heavier than others. These three elements work together to test if the idea is what both the user and the designer want. </p>

          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">"Design systems offer a different way of thinking, where the designer is forced to consider many scenarios and constraints instead of relying on a one-off design process." </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">This quote reminds me of my experience of sketching. When sketching, I often need to draw a good structure first, determine the proportion of each object before adding details step by step. If I focus on a certain detail and lose the observation of the whole, it is difficult for me to get a harmonious painting. The same goes for design. Systematic thinking can help designers to discover the commonality and rules of things from many aspects, so as to better serve the users. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“The design process is one of trial and error, and it often takes many iterations to create a design that clearly communicates what you're trying to say.“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">Design is a continuous process of finding mistakes and correcting them. First, the environment is constantly changing. Previously correct solutions may become less efficient or seem wrong as time passes. In addition, only by constantly making mistakes and correcting them can a person discover what he or she did not know before, and thus really delve into a certain area. Therefore, as designers, we should consider making mistakes to be the norm. As a designer, do not be afraid to make mistakes and keep up learning new things would be the thing I should keep in my mind. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“Code allows designers to not just create designs, but build digital systems that create designs.“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">With the development of the times, programming is no longer just a specialized skill for engineers. As designers, programming is the means by which we achieve prototyping and is a helper in achieving or even improving our design specifications. </p>

          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">"Like the smartphone, the internet of things isn’t a single technology." </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">The Internet of Things is not a particular technology, but a combination of technologies. Through the Internet of Everything, this system provides not one service, but a whole network connected from one point to get a variety of services. This will undoubtedly make people's lives more and more convenient.</p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“My concern here isn’t so much to point out that the internet of things is a security nightmare, although it certainly is. What I want to emphasize is that, in very large part, this is a direct consequence of commercial decisions, and a problem of business model.“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">Technology is often a double-edged sword. While we are gaining convenience through the Internet of Things, it has also become a powerful tool for some evil people to victimize others. For example, abusing people in their homes through remote control of smart homes and snooping on others' privacy through intrusive cameras.</p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead text-start mb-3">“At this largest scale, the internet of things appears to us as a body of rhetoric around the performance and behavior of the so-called “smart city.”“ </p>
          <p class=" text-start mb-5">The Internet of Things is the smart home in the home. When this extends to the city, this becomes the smart city. Many governments today are already promoting the development of smart cities. By improving smart cities, people can make better use of resources and improve efficiency. </p>
