          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead fw-normal mb-3">"What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact." </p>
          <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">The core of a prototype is to help the viewer better understand the product or explore its possibilities. It is the bridge between the designer's imagination and the future work. Therefore, neither what the prototype is made from nor how the prototype is made should be considered important, but it is the ideas and insights behind the prototype that are important as long as designers can convey theirs message to the audience. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead fw-normal mb-3">“In the authors’ experience, no one tool supports iterative design work in all of the important areas of investigation.“ </p>
          <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">Since each prototype is designed to fit its specific usage scenario, the purpose of the prototype varies. Also, different prototyping approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Something like paper prototyping takes less time and so allows the designer to test multiple potential solutions, while C is more accurate and powerful and can show enough details. Therefore, when designers are prototyping, it is really essential to embrace the different things. </p>
          <p class="fs-4 fst-italic lead fw-normal mb-3">“We define the dimensions of the model as role; look and feel; and implementation.“ </p>
          <p class=" fw-normal mb-5">This tells us the key factors in making and testing the prototype. Using the terms in IxD to interpret them, “role” is “user”; “look and feel” is the “user experience” and “interactions”; “implementation” is “technology” and “features”. Combining what the book said and what I learned in IxD, prototypes were made to test if the functionality catered to what we were supposed to make the user feel and do. None of these elements were heavier than others. These three elements work together to test if the idea is what both the user and the designer want. </p>
