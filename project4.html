            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">After deciding on the concept, I went online to see if there was something I could refer to, and I found this video tutorial. This tutorial mainly taught me how to code the starfield so I could explore on my own how to use the controls to interact with the system.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/5.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">Then there are the tools for physical programming. Here I used the Photon board.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/6.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">This is the place where I need to think about what types of sensors I need to use and how they interact with my system. This was my first plan for the system: to use pressure sensors, sliding potentiometers, potentiometers, and buttons.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/7.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">However, with the crtis in class, I found the plan was not working with my concept. My goal is to try my best to mimic the real experience of traveling in the space. However, having the user use buttons to change the view of space, or potentiometers to change the color of space, did not make sense. These are not experiences that users can have.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/8.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">So I did another round of inspiration. In sci-fi movies and games, there is always the concept of putting "energy cubes" in the engine to power the system. I thought it was an interesting and reasonable way to play.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/9.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">With the new concept, I modified the controller to have a pressure sensor, a sliding potentiometer, a rotary potentiometer and a gas pedal.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/10.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">I decided to use the pressure sensor to detect if the energy cube is placed in the engine; the gas pedal and rotation potentiometer to control the direction/view of the ship; and the sliding potentiometer to control the speed of the star and simulate redshift to the background.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/11.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">Then I started building my physics board. One of the problems I encountered here was that the accelerometer I got had separate chips and pins. So I soldered the parts together with a soldering iron before using them.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/12.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">Here is the physical board and my code. When coding, I found an effective way to learn coding is to use google wisely. by browsing tutorials, answers in forums, I can get the solution I need in most cases. Also, never being afraid to make mistakes was another thing that helped me learn the functionality of the code.</p>
            <img class="full" src="Project4/image/13.jpeg">
            <p class=" text-start py-5 px-5 bg-light">Here's a combination of storyboarding and prototyping.</p>
